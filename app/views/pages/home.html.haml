      %h3.about-heading Hi, Iâ€™m anthony mclaughlin
      %p.about-paragraph
        I'm a passionate UX designer with over 6 years of experience creating digital experiences that users love. My approach combines user research, creative problem-solving, and strategic thinking to design solutions that are both beautiful and functional.
      %p.about-paragraph
        I believe great design happens when we truly understand our users' needs, pain points, and goals. That's why I always start with research and testing, ensuring every design decision is backed by real user insights.
      %p.about-paragraph
        When I'm not designing, you can find me hiking mountain trails, experimenting with photography, or exploring new coffee shops around the city.
