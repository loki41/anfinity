  "project_overview": "The App Switcher project was initiated to provide a seamless, centralized way for users to move between Learning Pool's suite of applications. With 15+ apps in the ecosystem, each requiring separate logins and no native navigation between them, users faced unnecessary friction. This project introduced an app switcher component integrated across platforms, backed by a shared design system and single sign-on functionality to deliver a unified, user-first experience.",

      "Many users manually bookmarked and logged into each app daily.",

    "challenge": "With no central place for users to view or access their applications—and rebranding constraints removing names and icons—users struggled to navigate the ecosystem effectively.",
