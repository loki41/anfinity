      %p
        Hi! My name is Anthony, I'm a passionate UX designer with over 8 years of experience creating meaningful digital experiences that solve real user problems and drive business results.

      %p
        Most recently at Omniplex Learning, I served as the sole principal designer for a growing SaaS product team. 
        I built the design function from the ground up—introducing scalable systems, shaping processes, and leading 
        a full UI redesign that significantly improved usability and positioned the product for long-term growth.
      %p
        Prior to that, I spent nearly a decade at Learning Pool, where I advanced from full-stack developer to 
        frontend specialist, and ultimately to UX Team Lead after founding the company’s first dedicated UX team.
        I led UX efforts across 15 products within a fast-paced e-learning company of over 400 employees, 
        delivering user-centered solutions from discovery through to testing.
      %p
        What drives me is the depth and variety of UX—transforming real problems into clear, testable, and 
        effective solutions. I thrive on bringing structure to ambiguity and creating experiences that are both 
        intuitive and impactful.
