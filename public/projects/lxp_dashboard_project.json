  "project_overview": "The LXP Dashboard redesign aimed to address growing concerns from sales and enterprise customers around usability, scalability, and visual design. The existing dashboard was often described as outdated, cramped, and unintuitive—leading to lost bids and poor learner engagement. Our objective was to overhaul the user experience, focusing on navigation, content prioritization, and user actions, all while operating within the constraints of the existing platform architecture.",
